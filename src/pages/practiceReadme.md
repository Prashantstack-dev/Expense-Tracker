<!-- ExpenseContext.jsx readme to understand  -->
  <!-- Context = 3 things, in order:

Create the board → createContext() — the board exists but nothing is on it
Mount the board on the wall → <ExpenseContext.Provider> — now everyone can see it
Pin something to it → value={{ expenses }} — now everyone can read the data

Without 1 — no board. Without 2 — board in a cupboard. Without 3 — empty board. -->
